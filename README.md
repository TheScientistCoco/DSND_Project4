## Installation:

The program is running on Python 3, the following packages are needed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, math, calendar, time, json and sklearn.

## Project Motivation:

Understanding the customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, specifically, the customer response to different offers, will help the company provide better customer experiences and increase the revenue. In this project, I would like to bulid a machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer will respond to certain offers, based on the customerâ€™s transactions and demographic information.

## File Descriptions:

Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb includes all the steps to build the classification model, using the define, analyze, implement procedure.

Blog_Post.pdf contains a a blog post written for a technical audience, where I described the details to build the model, and the model's performance.

In the data folder, the data is contained in three json files:
- portfolio: containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
- profile: demographic data for each customer.
- transcript: records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

## Instructions:

The jupyter notebook should be run in Python 3 environment. The data folder should be downloaded into the same directory.
